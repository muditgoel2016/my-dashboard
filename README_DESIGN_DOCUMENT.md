# Design Implementation Documentation

## Layout Implementation

1. Page Structure Alignment

  - Base Layout: Navigation + Top Bar + Main Content area
  - Grid System: Flex-based irregular grid supporting variable cell counts
  - Component Housing: Grid cells contain paper components for widget placement
  - Component Header Design: Transparent bars with titles align with Figma specs
  - Page Variations: Single grid cell with paper for non-dashboard pages
  - Design Pattern: Identified recurring "paper-in-grid" pattern across Figma mockups, enabling systematic implementation


## Design System Implementation

1. Typography
  - Font styles aligned with Figma using Next.js font system
  - Text sizing matches mockup specifications
  - Font weights follow Figma guidelines
  - Line heights maintained per design

2. Color System
  - Implemented credit card color variations:
    - Black card with specified gradient effect
    - White card maintaining clean design
  - Color palette matches Figma specs
  - Maintained consistent text colors (#343C6A etc.)

3. Component-Specific Implementations

  Credit Cards:
  - Data-driven styling approach for different variants
  - Gradient implementation for black card
  - EMV chip placement matching mockup
  - Card number formatting and spacing as per design

  Dashboard Widgets:
  - Balance history chart styling
  - Transaction list format
  - Statistics widget layout
  - Weekly activity visualization

## Design Adaptations & Decisions

1. Icon Implementation
  - Custom SVGs used for key elements:
    - Soar Task logo
    - EMV chip on cards
  - Lucide-react icons substituted for similar icons
    - Chosen for close visual match
    - Can be replaced with exact mockup SVGs if needed

2. UI Component Choices
  - ShadCn UI components selected and customized:
    - Matches Figma design language
    - Modified to align with mockup styling
    - Maintains consistent look and feel
    - Provides full component code ownership

3. Responsive Design
  - Separate mobile/desktop layouts:
    - Maintains design language across breakpoints
    - Preserves component styling in both views

## Design Consistency Measures

1. Spacing System
  - Consistent spacing units matching Figma
  - Maintained component padding/margins

2. Interactive Elements
  - Active states for navigation
  - Focus states maintaining design guidelines (accent lines for side nav bar active option and active tabs)

3. Visual Feedback
  - Given visual feedback via Toast notifications
  - Loading states and hover animation for see all, send and save buttons.
